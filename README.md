# Data115_Group_Project_Oil_Price_comparison_between_Covid_and_2008
Group project for Data 115 Oil prices and stock prices compared to Covid and 2008 economic crashes
## Interest in Topic
We are living in a time of a pandemic that has vastly changed the way our society functions and we lived through the Crash of 2008, so it is interesting to look at other big impacts of these big events. Especially as we are older now and more aware of the economy, it is more interesting to look at how this compares to 2008. 
## Motivating Questions
- How is the crash of 2008 similar to what is happening due to the Coronavirus?  

- What similarities do we see between Oil Prices and the value of Stocks? 

- How does the recovery from the economic impact of COVID compare to the recovery from the 2008 economic crisis?
## Data Process
We downloaded our Oil Price data from (https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/pet_pri_gnd_a_epm0_pte_dpgal_w.htm ). We used the data for Price of Oil per Gallon every week from April of 1993 to November 2020. We averaged the data from the East Coast, West Coast and MidWest in the USA to get a good representation of the data. We got our Stock Price data from We downloaded our Oil Price data from (https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC/history/) and used the same time intervals as the Oil data.  

We then cleaned the data in Excel, which just consisted of deleting a few useless rows that did not contain data. Then we converted those files into cleaned up csvâ€™s.
