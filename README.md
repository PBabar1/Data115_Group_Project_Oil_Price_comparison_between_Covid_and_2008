# An Economic Comparison Between the Crash caused by COVID-19 and the Crash of 2008
 by Tom Synoground, Kian Ankerson, Zach Fechko, and Elliot Kimsey
## Interest in Topic
We are living in a time of a pandemic that has vastly changed the way our society functions and we lived through the Crash of 2008, so it is interesting to look at other big impacts of these big events. Especially as we are older now and more aware of things like politics, and the economy, we are more invested in these things and want our own answers instead of listening to whatever gets told to us by the news or media. The media and news' effect on our generation has led to people believing whatever is told to them, without having an opposing view, or giving us enough specifics on the conclusions that people make so quickly. While this data doesn't show us the effects of things like deaths in each year, it does show us the state of the economy and that has an affect on everyone whether or not they may realize it. 
## Motivating Questions
- How is the economic crash of 2008 similar to what is happening economically, due to the Coronavirus?  

- What similarities do we see between Oil Prices and the value of Stocks? 

- How does the recovery from the economic impact of COVID compare to the recovery from the 2008 economic crisis?

## Data Process
#### Raw Data
We downloaded our Oil Price data from (https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/pet_pri_gnd_a_epm0_pte_dpgal_w.htm ). The data we used was from three different regions in the United States, and was measured in dollars per gallon of oil. We averaged the data from the East Coast, West Coast and MidWest in the USA to get a good representation of the data. 
We got our Stock Price data from We downloaded our Oil Price data from (https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC/history/) and used the same time intervals as the Oil data.
The data we chose to use can give us all of the information we need to answer these questions. We can look at specific price drops at any date we want and compare the datasets to each other. 
#### Cleaning
Both sources of the data we chose are very reliable sources, and so the data was already in pretty good shape. We further cleaned the data in Excel, which just consisted of deleting the first few useless rows that did not contain data. Then we converted those files into cleaned up csv’s so that Python can easily read them. 
#### Visualizations
We imported the csv’s into Python and graphed line plots based on the Average Oil Price of the three regions, and graphed the Stock Prices. We also changed the x and y bounds and made graphs of both Oil and Stocks zoomed in on the Crash of 2008 and the Crash due to COVID-19.
Finally, we cleaned up the x-axes, as the measurements of time were the same units. Then we added labels to the main graphs and added some helpful points of interest. 
We decided that we also wanted to take closer look at the time periods when those large price drops occured, so we could compare their relative drop in price, and how they compared Oil compared to Stocks in that aspect. I used our previous graphs and changed the x and y limits to change our window of view on the data. 

## Analysis
#### Main Focus
In our analysis we looked at how bad the price crashed in 2008 and 2020 for both the price of Oil Per Gallon in the United States and the price of the S&P 500 market index fund. To do this, we used Excel to locate the highs and low points for the time of each crash.  

#### Big Picture
For the oil crash in 2008, we used price data from March 2007 to June 2009 and found the highest was  ~$4.24 per gallon before the crash, and the lowest was ~$1.72, during the crash. In 2020, for the period of time from November 2019 to November 2020, we found the highest was ~$2.91 before the crash and the lowest was ~$1.99 during the crash. It’s important to note that before the big oil crash in 2020 from the COVID-19 Pandemic, Oil prices were already decreasing slightly.

#### Direct Comparison of the two Crashes
We did very similar steps in finding the high and low points for the stock price of the S&P 500 during the same time periods. Again using Excel, we found the S&P 500 reached a high of $1565.15 before the crash in 2008, and hit a low of $676.53 during the crash. Before the COVID pandemic in 2020, the highest price of the S&P500 was $3638.35 and during the lowest price was $2237.40. 

Using these numbers we calculated the relative price drops in order to determine the actual severity of both market crashes. After finding the relative price crash percentage, we saw that the market crash in 2008 for both the stock numbers (S&P 500) and Oil prices were worse than the more recent crash in 2020. In 2008 the S&P 500 dropped 56.78% and oil dropped 59.43%, while in 2020 the S&P 500 dropped 38.50% and oil prices fell 31.61%.

An interesting thing here to note is that while the crash of oil prices was relatively worse in 2008 than 2020, if you account for inflation, the lowest price of oil in 2020 was lower than its worse during the 2008, while doing the same for the S&P 500 was did not show the same behavior. According to the [Bureau of Labor Statistics Inflation Calculator](https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm) after plugging in the months each low was hit during, we see $1 in December 2008 is equivalent to $1.22 in April 2020. Using these to account for inflation tells us that the worst oil prices in 2020 were almost 10 cents worse than in 2008 ($1.72 2008 and $1.63 in 2020 after reversing inflation).


#### Close Up Comparison
Taking a closer look at the data, we can see how both the Oil Price and the Stock Price drops vary in each year. We can see for Oil, in both 2008 and 2020 it drops to about 2 dollars a Gallon, but in 2008 it starts at a much higher price before the crash happened. For the Stock market, we notice that the overall price is higher in 2020, but the relative drop we see is larger in 2008 than it is in 2020.

## Methods
#### Excel Hi/Lo Function 
In Excel, we used the High/Low Function to easily find those data points so that we could use numbers for the two Crashes to compare their relative percentage price drop. 

#### Axis Limit Adjustments 
When constructing our visualizations in python, we had to use plt.xlim and plt.ylim to to change the bounds of our graph, so that we could zoom in on the specific time and price ranges we wanted. 
## Conclusions
It is interesting to look at the Graphs from 1993 to Present, and see just how good of a job they do at showing us when major events in the United States occured. They tell parts of our country's history and can be explained by looking at the data. Since we already had an idea of what time period we wanted to look at, it was easier to represent those events with our data. But if somebody was viewing these graphs with no context or labels, they would want to know what caused the huge dips that we see. 

While we do see large similarities with both Oil Price and Stock Price in the two economic crises, The Crash of 2008 was more severe of a crisis, strictly from an economic view. 

## Future Analysis
In the future it would be interesting to look at updated graphs for this data. We cannot compare the recovery from the two Economic crashes we looked at, as we are not in the recovery phase of the Crash caused by COVID-19 yet.  

It might also be interesting to investigate patterns that happens in datasets like these to see if we can predict right before big Crashes like this happen. It would be interesting to see if they occurred in a certain time of year each time, or something like that. 

We might need to collect data and do some more reading to find out what to look at and what to look for because the there are countless factors that affect our economy. I would guess looking into growth of technologies during these time periods, or change in pivotal legislation. Pinning down the important and relevant ones to this topic would be where I think we could take this analysis further.
