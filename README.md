## Data Process
We downloaded our Oil Price data from (https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/pet_pri_gnd_a_epm0_pte_dpgal_w.htm ). We used the data for Price of Oil per Gallon every week from April of 1993 to November 2020. We averaged the data from the East Coast, West Coast and MidWest in the USA to get a good representation of the data. We got our Stock Price data from We downloaded our Oil Price data from (https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC/history/) and used the same time intervals as the Oil data.  

We then cleaned the data in Excel, which just consisted of deleting a few useless rows that did not contain data. Then we converted those files into cleaned up csvâ€™s.
